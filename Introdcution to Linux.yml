Why Should You Learn about Linux?:
----------------------------------|

Linux is a critical technology for IT professionals to understand.

Linux is in widespread use, and if you use the internet at all, you are probably already interacting with Linux systems in your daily life. Perhaps the most obvious way in which you interact with Linux systems is through browsing the World Wide Web and using e-commerce sites to buy and sell products.

However, Linux is in use for much more than that. Linux manages point-of-sale systems and the world's stock markets, and also powers smart TVs and in-flight entertainment systems. It powers most of the top 500 supercomputers in the world. Linux provides the foundational technologies powering the cloud revolution and the tools used to build the next generation of container-based micro services applications, software-based storage technologies, and big data solutions.

In the modern data center, Linux and Microsoft Windows are the major players, and Linux is a growing segment in that space. Some of the many reasons to learn Linux include:

    A Windows user needs to interoperate with Linux.
    In application development, Linux hosts the application or its runtime.
    In cloud computing, the cloud instances in the private or public cloud environment use Linux as the operating system.
    With mobile applications or the Internet of Things (IoT), the chances are high that the operating system of your device uses Linux.
    If you are looking for new opportunities in IT, Linux skills are in high demand.

What Makes Linux Great?:
------------------------|

There are many different answers to the question "What makes Linux great?", however, three of them are:

    Linux is open source software.

    Being open source does not just mean that you can see how the system works. You can also experiment with changes and share them freely for others to use. The open source model means that improvements are easier to make, enabling faster innovation.

    Linux provides easy access to a powerful and scriptable command-line interface (CLI) .

    Linux was built around the basic design philosophy that users can perform all administration tasks from the CLI. It enables easier automation, deployment, and provisioning, and simplifies both local and remote system administration. Unlike other operating systems, these capabilities have been built in from the beginning, and the assumption has always been to enable these important capabilities.

    Linux is a modular operating system that allows you to easily replace or remove components.

    Components of the system can be upgraded and updated as needed. A Linux system can be a general-purpose development workstation or an extremely stripped-down software appliance.
