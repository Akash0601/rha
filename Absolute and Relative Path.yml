Absolute Paths , Relative Paths:
===============================================================================================================================


Absolute Paths

An absolute path is a fully qualified name, specifying the files exact location in the file system
hierarchy. It begins at the root (/) directory and specifies each subdirectory that must be
traversed to reach the specific file. Every file in a file system has a unique absolute path name,
recognized with a simple rule: A path name with a forward slash (/) as the first character is an
absolute path name. For example, the absolute path name for the system message log file is /var/log/messages. Absolute path names can be long to type, so files may also be located relative to the current working directory for your shell prompt.


The Current Working Directory and Relative Paths

When a user logs in and opens a command window, the initial location is normally the user's home
directory. System processes also have an initial directory. Users and processes navigate to other
directories as needed; the terms working directory or current working directory refer to their
current location.
Like an absolute path, a relative path identifies a unique file, specifying only the path necessary to
reach the file from the working directory. Recognizing relative path names follows a simple rule: A
path name with anything other than a forward slash as the first character is a relative path name. A
user in the /var directory could refer to the message log file relatively as log/messages.


NAVIGATING PATHS

The pwd command displays the full path name of the current working directory for that shell. This
can help you determine the syntax to reach files using relative path names. The ls command lists
directory contents for the specified directory or, if no directory is given, for the current working
directory.

[user@host ~]$ pwd
