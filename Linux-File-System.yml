The File-System Hierarchy
===========================================================================================================================

"On a LINUX system, everything is a file; if something is not a file, it is a process."

Most files are just files, called regular files; they contain normal data, for example text files, executable files or
programs, input for or output from a program and so on.
While it is reasonably safe to suppose that everything you encounter on a Linux system is a file, there are some exceptions.

    Directories: files that are lists of other files.

    Special files: the mechanism used for input and output. Most special files are in /dev, we will discuss them later.

    Links: a system to make a file or directory visible in multiple parts of the system's file tree. We will talk about 
    links in detail.s

    (Domain) sockets: a special file type, similar to TCP/IP sockets, providing inter-process networking protected by the
    file system's access control.

    Named pipes: act more or less like sockets and form a way for processes to communicate with each other, without 
    using network socket semantics.

The -l option to ls displays the file type, using the first character of each input line:

All files on a Linux system are stored on file systems, which are organized into a single inverted tree of directories,
known as a file-system hierarchy. This tree is inverted because the root of the tree  is said to be at the top of the
hierarchy, and the branches of directories and sub-directories stretch below the root.

The File-system Hierarchy:
===========================================================================================================================

All files on a Linux system are stored on file systems, which are organized into a single inverted tree of directories,
known as a file-system hierarchy . This tree is inverted because the root of the tree is said to be at the top of the 
hierarchy, and the branches of directories and subdirectories stretch below the root.

The/directory is the root directory at the top of the file-system hierarchy. The/character is also used as a directory
separator in file names. For example, ifetcis a subdirectory of the/directory, you could refer to that directory as/etc.
Likewise, if the/etcdirectory contained a file namedissue, you could refer to that file as/etc/issue.

Subdirectories of/are used for standardized purposes to organize files by type and purpose. This makes  it easier to find 
files. For example, in the root directory, the subdirectory/bootis used for storing files needed to boot the system.

Note
The following terms help to describe file-system directory contents:

    static content remains unchanged until explicitly edited or reconfigured.

    dynamic or variable content may be modified or appended by active processes.

    persistent content remains after a reboot, like configuration settings.

    runtime content is process- or system-specific content that is deleted by a reboot.
    
    The following table lists some of the most important directories on the system by name and purpose.
    

Important CentOS Linux Directories
Location 	   Purpose
/usr	       Installed software, shared libraries, include files, and read-only program data. Important subdirectories
               include:
               /usr/bin:      User commands.
               /usr/sbin:     System administration commands.
               /usr/local:    Locally customized software.
               
/etc	       Configuration files specific to this system.
/var	       Variable data specific to this system that should persist between boots. Files that dynamically change, such
               as databases, cache directories, log files, printer-spooled documents, and website content may be found under
               /var .
               
/run	       Runtime data for processes started since the last boot. This includes process ID files and lock files, among
               other things. The contents of this directory are recreated on reboot. This directory consolidates /var/run
               and /var/lock from earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
               
/home	       Home directories are where regular users store their personal data and configuration files.

/root	       Home directory for the administrative superuser, root .

/tmp	       A world-writable space for temporary files. Files which have not been accessed, changed, or modified for 10
               days are deleted from this directory automatically. Another temporary directory exists, /var/tmp , in which 
               files that have not been accessed, changed, or modified in more than 30 days are deleted automatically.
               
/boot          Files needed in order to start the boot process.

/dev	       Contains special device files that are used by the system to access hardware. 

 Important

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later, four older directories in/have identical contents to their counterparts located in/usr:

    /binand/usr/bin

    /sbinand/usr/sbin

    /liband/usr/lib

    /lib64and/usr/lib64

In earlier versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, these were distinct directories containing different sets of files.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later, the directories in/are symbolic links to the matching directories in/usr.
